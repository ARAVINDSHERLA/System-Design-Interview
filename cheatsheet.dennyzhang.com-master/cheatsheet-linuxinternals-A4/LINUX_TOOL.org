*** What is shared(shared Memory) in the free output?
- Shared: Memory taken by the tmpfs file systems.

- tmpfs: a mounted file system, with data stored in RAM.
*** In the output of free command, why free is different from *available*?
*** In the output of free command, what is Low and High?
- On a 32-bit Linux based operating system, the CPU can address a maximum of 4GB of memory. (2^32 = 4GB)
- On 32-bits, kernel itself (including its active modules) can only make use of low memory.
- On a 64-bit computer there will be no values shown for high memory.
- High memory is the part of physical memory in a computer which is not directly mapped by the page tables of its operating system kernel.

NAME
       free - Display amount of free and used memory in the system

SYNOPSIS
       free [options]

DESCRIPTION
       free  displays  the  total amount of free and used physical and swap memory in the system, as well as the buffers and caches used by the kernel. The information is gathered by parsing /proc/meminfo.
       The displayed columns are:

       total  Total installed memory (MemTotal and SwapTotal in /proc/meminfo)

       used   Used memory (calculated as total - free - buffers - cache)

       free   Unused memory (MemFree and SwapFree in /proc/meminfo)

       shared Memory used (mostly) by tmpfs (Shmem in /proc/meminfo, available on kernels 2.6.32, displayed as zero if not available)

       buffers
              Memory used by kernel buffers (Buffers in /proc/meminfo)

       cache  Memory used by the page cache and slabs (Cached and SReclaimable in /proc/meminfo)

       buff/cache
              Sum of buffers and cache

       available
              Estimation of how much memory is available for starting new applications, without swapping. Unlike the data provided by the cache or free fields, this field takes into account page cache  and
              also  that  not  all reclaimable memory slabs will be reclaimed due to items being in use (MemAvailable in /proc/meminfo, available on kernels 3.14, emulated on kernels 2.6.27+, otherwise the
              same as free)

OPTIONS
       -b, --bytes
              Display the amount of memory in bytes.

       -k, --kilo
              Display the amount of memory in kilobytes.  This is the default.

       -m, --mega
              Display the amount of memory in megabytes.

       -g, --giga
              Display the amount of memory in gigabytes.

       --tera Display the amount of memory in terabytes.

       --peta Display the amount of memory in petabytes.

       -h, --human
              Show all output fields automatically scaled to shortest three digit unit and display the units of print out.  Following units are used.

                B = bytes
                K = kilos
                M = megas
                G = gigas
                T = teras
                P = petas

              If unit is missing, and you have exabyte of RAM or swap, the number is in terabytes and columns might not be aligned with header.

       -w, --wide
              Switch to the wide mode. The wide mode produces lines longer than 80 characters. In this mode buffers and cache are reported in two separate columns.

       -c, --count count
              Display the result count times.  Requires the -s option.

       -l, --lohi
              Show detailed low and high memory statistics.

       -s, --seconds seconds
              Continuously display the result delay seconds apart.  You may actually specify any floating point number for delay, usleep(3) is used for microsecond resolution delay times.

       --si   Use power of 1000 not 1024.

       -t, --total
              Display a line showing the column totals.

       --help Print help.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

FILES
       /proc/meminfo
              memory information

NOTES
       This program is obsolete.  Replacement for netstat is ss.  Replacement for netstat -r is ip route.  Replacement for netstat -i is ip -s  link.   Replace‐
       ment for netstat -g is ip maddr.


DESCRIPTION
       Netstat prints information about the Linux networking subsystem.  The type of information printed is controlled by the first argument, as follows:

   (none)
       By  default, netstat displays a list of open sockets.  If you don't specify any address families, then the active sockets of all configured address fami‐
       lies will be printed.

   --route , -r
       Display the kernel routing tables. See the description in route(8) for details.  netstat -r and route -e produce the same output.

   --groups , -g
       Display multicast group membership information for IPv4 and IPv6.

   --interfaces=iface , -I=iface , -i
       Display a table of all network interfaces, or the specified iface.

   --masquerade , -M
       Display a list of masqueraded connections.

   --statistics , -s
       Display summary statistics for each protocol.

OPTIONS
   --verbose , -v
       Tell the user what is going on by being verbose. Especially print some useful information about unconfigured address families.

   --wide , -W
       Do not truncate IP addresses by using output as wide as needed. This is optional for now to not break existing scripts.

   --numeric , -n
       Show numerical addresses instead of trying to determine symbolic host, port or user names.

   --numeric-hosts
       shows numerical host addresses but does not affect the resolution of port or user names.

   --numeric-ports
       shows numerical port numbers but does not affect the resolution of host or user names.

   --numeric-users
       shows numerical user IDs but does not affect the resolution of host or port names.


   --protocol=family , -A
       Specifies the address families (perhaps better described as low level protocols) for which connections are to be shown.  family is a  comma  (',')  sepa‐
       rated  list  of  address  family  keywords  like inet, inet6, unix, ipx, ax25, netrom, econet, and ddp.  This has the same effect as using the --inet|-4,
       --inet6|-6, --unix|-x, --ipx, --ax25, --netrom, and --ddp options.

       The address family inet (Iv4) includes raw, udp, udplite and tcp protocol sockets.

   -c, --continuous
       This will cause netstat to print the selected information every second continuously.

   -e, --extend
       Display additional information.  Use this option twice for maximum detail.

   -o, --timers
       Include information related to networking timers.

   -p, --program
       Show the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs.

   -l, --listening
       Show only listening sockets.  (These are omitted by default.)

   -a, --all
       Show both listening and non-listening (for TCP this means established connections) sockets.  With the --interfaces option, show interfaces that  are  not
       up

   -F
       Print routing information from the FIB.  (This is the default.)

   -C
       Print routing information from the route cache.

   delay
       Netstat will cycle printing through statistics every delay seconds.

OUTPUT
   Active Internet connections (TCP, UDP, UDPLite, raw)
   Proto
       The protocol (tcp, udp, udpl, raw) used by the socket.

   Recv-Q
       Established: The count of bytes not copied by the user program connected to this socket.  Listening: Since Kernel 2.6.18 this column contains the current
       syn backlog.

   Send-Q
       Established: The count of bytes not acknowledged by the remote host.  Listening: Since Kernel 2.6.18 this column contains the maximum  size  of  the  syn
       backlog.

   Local Address
       Address  and  port number of the local end of the socket.  Unless the --numeric (-n) option is specified, the socket address is resolved to its canonical
       host name (FQDN), and the port number is translated into the corresponding service name.

   Foreign Address
       Address and port number of the remote end of the socket.  Analogous to "Local Address."

   State
       The state of the socket. Since there are no states in raw mode and usually no states used in UDP and UDPLite, this column may  be  left  blank.  Normally
       this can be one of several values:

       ESTABLISHED
              The socket has an established connection.

       SYN_SENT
              The socket is actively attempting to establish a connection.

       SYN_RECV
              A connection request has been received from the network.

       FIN_WAIT1
              The socket is closed, and the connection is shutting down.

       FIN_WAIT2
              Connection is closed, and the socket is waiting for a shutdown from the remote end.

       TIME_WAIT
              The socket is waiting after close to handle packets still in the network.

       CLOSE  The socket is not being used.

       CLOSE_WAIT
              The remote end has shut down, waiting for the socket to close.

       LAST_ACK
              The remote end has shut down, and the socket is closed. Waiting for acknowledgement.

       LISTEN The  socket  is  listening for incoming connections.  Such sockets are not included in the output unless you specify the --listening (-l) or --all
              (-a) option.

       CLOSING
              Both sockets are shut down but we still don't have all our data sent.

       UNKNOWN
              The state of the socket is unknown.

   User
       The username or the user id (UID) of the owner of the socket.

   PID/Program name
       Slash-separated pair of the process id (PID) and process name of the process that owns the socket.  --program causes this column  to  be  included.   You
       will also need superuser privileges to see this information on sockets you don't own.  This identification information is not yet available for IPX sock‐
       ets.

   Timer
       (this needs to be written)

   Active UNIX domain Sockets
   Proto
       The protocol (usually unix) used by the socket.

   RefCnt
       The reference count (i.e. attached processes via this socket).

   Flags
       The flags displayed is SO_ACCEPTON (displayed as ACC), SO_WAITDATA (W) or SO_NOSPACE (N).  SO_ACCECPTON is used on unconnected sockets  if  their  corre‐
       sponding processes are waiting for a connect request. The other flags are not of normal interest.

   Type
       There are several types of socket access:

       SOCK_DGRAM
              The socket is used in Datagram (connectionless) mode.

       SOCK_STREAM
              This is a stream (connection) socket.

       SOCK_RAW
              The socket is used as a raw socket.

       SOCK_RDM
              This one serves reliably-delivered messages.

       SOCK_SEQPACKET
              This is a sequential packet socket.

       SOCK_PACKET
              Raw interface access socket.

       UNKNOWN
              Who ever knows what the future will bring us - just fill in here :-)

   State
       This field will contain one of the following Keywords:

       FREE   The socket is not allocated

       LISTENING
              The  socket is listening for a connection request.  Such sockets are only included in the output if you specify the --listening (-l) or --all (-a)
              option.

       CONNECTING
              The socket is about to establish a connection.

       CONNECTED
              The socket is connected.

       DISCONNECTING
              The socket is disconnecting.

       (empty)
              The socket is not connected to another one.

       UNKNOWN
              This state should never happen.

   PID/Program name
       Process ID (PID) and process name of the process that has the socket open.  More info available in Active Internet connections section written above.

   Path
       This is the path name as which the corresponding processes attached to the socket.

   Active IPX sockets
       (this needs to be done by somebody who knows it)

   Active NET/ROM sockets
       (this needs to be done by somebody who knows it)

   Active AX.25 sockets
       (this needs to be done by somebody who knows it)

BUGS
       Occasionally strange information may appear if a socket changes as it is viewed. This is unlikely to occur.
