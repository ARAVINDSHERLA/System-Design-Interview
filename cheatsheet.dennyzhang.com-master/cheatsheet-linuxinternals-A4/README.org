What exactly is the firewall rule? ICMP has no ports and is neither TCP nor UDP. ICMP is IP protocol 1 (see RFC792), TCP is IP protocol 6 (described in RFC793) and UDP is IP protocol 17(see RFC768). UDP and TCP have ports, ICMP has no ports, but types and codes. I would say: don't filter ICMP until you know exactly what you are doing. Do you remember the issues when DSL was introduced and some servers were not reachable anymore via DSL connection but were reachable via the proxy-server of the ISP? The reason for that effect was wrong ICMP filtering on the "server site" firewall: thoses firewalls have filtered out ICMP "fragmentation needed" packets, and the servers were configured to do PMTUD (which is best common pratice since many years). PMTUD (Path MTU Discovery) relies on receiving ICMP "fragmentation needed" packets, if the MTU for the complete way between source and destination has a lower MTU than the MTU between source and next hop. The server sends his data with "don't fragment bit" set and reduces the MTU for sent packets to that specific destination, if it receives "fragmentation needed" ICMP packets from some device "on the way". If there is a device on the way, that throws away that ICMP "fragmentation needed" packets, the server resends the dropped packets, that are too large to reach the destination without fragmentation, again and again with the same high MTU, and they will be dropped again and again ...

If you really want to filter ICMP. do never filter ICMP unreachables. I would prefer to never filter ICMP at all (but you may ratelimit ICMP). ICMP filtering will (in my opinion) not lead to much more security, but it will make it much harder to find misconfigurations and reasons for network issues. In my opinion the disadvantages of filtering ICMP are much more than the advantages doing so ...

Production Engineers at Facebook are hybrid software/systems engineers who ensure that Facebook's services run smoothly and have the capacity for future growth.

You might be confused and thinking of it as a regular Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) role, but it's much more than it.

- SRE
- Software engineers
- Systems engineers

This round is the best thing about the whole process. You are typically not expected to write any code in this round. BUT are given an open-ended problem to solve. You need to talk aloud your strategy, debugging ideas, solutions and so on.

One random example will be: You are not able to serve files present in /var/www/htmlvia httpdprocess. What mistakes can you think of? How will you solve them?

You can think starting from file permissions, checking httpd config, iptables rules, and so on. There is no right answer but surely better answers when different candidates are compared.
