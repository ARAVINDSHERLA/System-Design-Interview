** DONE Process VS Thread
   CLOSED: [2020-02-19 Wed 09:54]
- Process can have multiple thread
- Threads inside one process have a common virtual memory space
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Process: stack, heap, text and data
Thread: own stack; shared heap, text and data
#+END_EXAMPLE
- Process the OS schedule unit
- Thread is more lightweight than process

** DONE Explain inode

Inode and Inode number

Note: there is no entry for file name in the Inode. We can have various file names which point to same Inode, say hard links.

[[https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/01/linux-inodes/][Understand UNIX / Linux Inodes Basics with Examples]]

Q: What's inside inode?

A: An Inode is a data structure that stores the following information about a file :

- Size of file
- Device ID
- User ID of the file
- Group ID of the file
- The file mode information and access privileges for owner, group and others
- File protection flags
- The timestamps for file creation, modification etc
- link counter to determine the number of hard links
- Pointers to the blocks storing file's contents

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[ec2-user@dennyzhang ~]$ stat /etc/hosts
  File: ‘/etc/hosts’
  Size: 126       	Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   regular file
Device: ca01h/51713d	Inode: 262187      Links: 1
Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)
Access: 2020-01-10 00:10:19.474123510 +0000
Modify: 2020-01-10 00:10:19.464123517 +0000
Change: 2020-01-10 00:10:19.464123517 +0000
 Birth: -
#+END_EXAMPLE

A file system can run out of space in two ways:
- No space for adding new data is left
- All the Inodes are consumed. (Run "df -i" to confirm. And this issue has a very small chance to happens, when tons of small sized files.)

Q: What about link attribute of inode for a folder?

A: Each files or sub-folders under this folder will increase the link. When removing the folder, the link count would be checked.

Q: How to release inode, when "df -i" complains out of inode?

A: TODO
** DONE Explain virtual memory
   CLOSED: [2020-02-19 Wed 23:23]
Virtual memory is an abstraction of the main memory.

Simply put, virtual memory is a combination of RAM and disk space that running processes can use.

Swap space is the portion of virtual memory that is on the hard disk, used when RAM is full.

Virtual memory uses a process called paging.

About swap memory:
- How to check swap space: "free -ml" or "cat /proc/swaps"
- Linux has two forms of swap space: swap partition and swap file

** DONE Explain paging and paging fault
   CLOSED: [2020-02-20 Thu 10:34]
- Paging: no need to allocate contiguous memory, to avoid external fragmentation
- MMU(memory management unit): a hardware device to map from virtual memory address to phsyical address.
- Page fault: access memory which is not stored in RAM. So locate the data in virtual memory, then transfer it from storage device to RAM.

** HALF epoll VS poll VS select
Use case: detect new I/O events from many FDs

** TODO Explain how OS schedules processes
- Process Scheduling: determine which process is in the ready state, and should be moved to the running state

[[image-blog:SRE: Linux Basic Concepts][https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dennyzhang/cheatsheet.dennyzhang.com/master/cheatsheet-linuxinternals-A4/process-scheduling.png]]

Process context switch:
- Store process context to process table
- Load the process context of new scheduld process
- Pass the control to kernel
** TODO Explain spinlock
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinlock

Use case: Busy waiting is a good idea when you know the wait is not too long. Spinlock can help your process keep busy waiting.

*** Signal can't be trapped: SIGKILL, SIGSTOP
*** How to log all signals
auditd or systemtap
