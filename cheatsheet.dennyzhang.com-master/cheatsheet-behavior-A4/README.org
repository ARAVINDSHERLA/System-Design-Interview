面狗家的下面必看啊（怕惹麻烦所以加个隐藏）
以前狗家5轮都是coding或者system design（除非你面的是manager）.大约半年前加了一个behavioral and leaderhsip round,所以如果你是L3,你会有4轮coding和一个BQ.但是HR好像没有给很多hint怎么准备.题目无非就是你讲故事,或者问你这个情况你会怎么做.大家不要误会那个leadership是要怎么管理别人.老美的leadership含义很广,对L3/4/5来说,leadership其实是怎么管理自己-自己的项目,进度,成长,沟通等等.Behavioral那都是common sense了,team work什么的.

亚麻的那个军规16条很好,可以做基础.狗家自己特别的是:
- 你得能管理自己的项目和进度,能够prioritize自己的项目.根据什么标准prioritize？你自己的喜好吗？亚麻军规里其实有,我不敢说的太明了.其实都是common sense
- 需求不明确怎么办？你会自己想办法吗？还是依赖别人？Project的需求总在变,你会撂摊子不干了,或者抱怨连天吗？
- 亚麻里有个having backbone,那是指manager.如果你的同事做了不好的事或者决定呢？你会视而不见或者和稀泥吗？想想狗家"不做恶"的信条,想想你怎么融入啊？

需要准备至少3-4个故事,比如怎么处理和team里的人的conflict,项目要miss deadline了怎么办的等等.实在没有？那也要编啊.一定要有细节,因为面试官会问得很细.还有一句"废话",要显示出你对产品的热情,对自己职业的热情,而不是就安于一个"码农",说说你怎么提高自己的,online course? open source project？

说实话我不觉得这种对非manager的BQ面试有什么用,只能过滤一下无脑的愣头青吧.但是你只要知道面试官想听的keyword,还是比涮题简单的吧.

另外,我们写面试报告的时候,不能用he or she,就是不想透露任何在HC环节能引起歧视的信息,包括年龄,种族等等.狗家在这点上真是很nice和认真的.所以大家回答问题的时候,可千万别一不小心说漏了嘴.那很可能是一票否决.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
历时2个多月的刷题和无数拒信后,楼主终于转专业上岸了,写一些关于BQ的经验回报地里吧.关于我认为的BQ问题的潜台词,我给您翻译翻译,这些BQ到底在问什么？现在BQ越来越重要了,我碰到两次面试,有一轮就是只问BQ,连续40分钟BQ快问快答,人都要疯掉了,说得口干舌燥.这里写一些常见的BQ吧,基本属于必考感觉.

介绍一个你最喜欢的项目？介绍下简历？介绍下自己？

翻译:有没有看职位要求？说说职位要求要找什么人？你是这样的人么？介绍一个你最符合这个职位要求的项目,最后强调你是good fit

你最大的缺点/失败？

翻译:你一个无伤大雅的小缺点/失败是什么？你从以前的哪个项目知道自己有这个缺点/失败？知道以后学到了什么教训？在后面哪个项目中吸取了这个教训,做了什么,取得了什么结果？

你最大的优点？

翻译:我知道你很牛,你哪个特质最符合这个职位的要求,并且在最后强调你的某某优点让你是一个good fit for this position

为什么选我们这个公司？

翻译:公司的mission是什么？我的career goal和你们公司的mission完美契合;职位的要求是什么？我的背景和能力和这个职位的要求完美契合.最后强调你是good fit

怎么知道这个职位的？

翻译:如实回答就行,我一般都说career fair和公司的工程师聊了聊,关键是最后要再重复一遍,据我了解,这个职位是干啥或者需要啥,我以前也在做这个或者有相关的技能,所以good fit

队友/同事不干活/很难相处咋办？

翻译:你有没有经常和队友/同事主动沟通？你愿不愿意为了团队,帮队友/同事分担一些工作？能不能以非常职业的方式解决这个问题？

队友/同事不同意你的观点咋办？

翻译:你有没有自己花一些时间做一个数字化（quantitative）的比较？有没有向队友/同事提交一个详细的报告或者比较（report/strong case）来说服ta？会不会有效的沟通？

你怎么定义成功？

翻译:一般我都说达到自己制定的目标就算成功,这样容易说;那就可以理解为你有没有为自己制定目标？你的目标是啥？你现在完成的怎么样？未来在这个公司想怎么发展自己？（develop tech stack,gain more domain knowledge,see myself in postion of senior engiener in xx years）

被安排了一个很难的任务咋办？

翻译:你会不会和你的老板沟通？你会不会和你的同事沟通？你会不会提出合理的要求？能不能以非常职业的方式解决这个问题？

任务的due被提前了咋办？有没有身背数个deadline的经历？
以下内容需要积分高于 20 您已经可以浏览

翻译:你是怎么管理你的时间的？比如日历上设置好项目,还有提醒;你会不会根据工作的优先级安排你的时间？你会不会为了项目组的整体利益考虑（best interest of my team）,舍弃一些个人利益？比如为了毕设,自己的考试就不投入太多时间;会不会和别人沟通寻找解决方案？如果你是组长,你知道due提前了会不会采取措施？比如立刻开会,重新安排这个项目后面的任务和时间节点.

为什么你是xx专业,却想做sde/ds/mle？

翻译:你之前哪段项目/实习经历做了有关sde/ds/mle的啥？你产生了啥影响,取得了啥结果？你是不是很享受你的产出？（是,所以我想转）

* [面试经验] LP/Behavior Question面试需要注意的细节 - 面试官是怎么想的 :noexport:
https://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=580119

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
在亚麻工作了三年多,作为面试官/shadower也参加了三十多场面试,感觉Behavior question上华人多少有些吃亏,想在这里总结一下.
以下说的都是个人体验,如果不认同/有补充的话欢迎友好讨论.

Behavior Question首先最大的一点是要真实.面试官问LP目的是为了招进来一个不仅代码能力强而且工作靠谱沟通顺畅的同事,而不是招个满嘴跑火车的人当码农.

要能够给面试官真实的感觉,回答要具体有逻辑.比如说面试官问:
Why our company?（不过据我所知这个问题不是亚麻的风格,一般除非你背景和职位很不符合才会这么问）
回答This is my dream company就不是一个很具体的答案,把work hard have fun make history背出来也不行（背这个可能还会让面试官觉得你姿态太低）.要指出公司的特色,解释为什么这种特色吸引你.如果投的是具体的role,顺便也解释一下为什么申请这个组/部门而不是别的.
比如亚马逊就是业务范围广,云服务领先,非常有执行力和创造力并且Customer-centric（AWS/Alexa/kindle 都是先驱性的产品）.在亚马逊工作能够让我有很多学习的机会.AWS这么大的scale的云服务,其中的Technical Challenge非常的让我感兴趣.

一般BQ会从简历问题开始问,简历上的项目经历不要写的太大,实事求是的写,不然问出来实际内容和简历描述相差甚远就尴尬了.面试官会就着一些技术细节问,目的是为了确保你真的做过这个项目.

亚麻的LP是有公开题库的,回答根据STAR原则就好.还是要具体有干货,当然是以不违反前公司隐私的前提下.

新人/工作经验不多的人没有什么decision making的经历,因此最容易问的是Deliver result,dive deep和ownership,其次是learn and be curious.
Dive deep和ownership大部分情况下是互通的.我见过最具体的一个例子,技术细节记不清了.说Interviewee在看dashboard时发现产品（当然他事先介绍过这个产品大概内容和构造）的performance not stable,latency graph has unexpected spike.他自学了一个profiling tool（他说了名字我不记得了）在分析性能之后找到了bug并且提升了产品性能和稳定性.他还简单介绍了一下这个bug是多线程死锁后造成的,因为死锁后有timeout和retry所以产品功能上没有影响.然后他利用这个profiling tool设置了新的alarm帮助更好地发现类似的bug.这个例子可以横跨learn and be curious, ownership 和 diving deep,很有说服力.

有几年工作经历的面试会有一些decision making experience,这种情况下会问are right a lot, having backbone, disagree&commit这些.总的来说我们要给自己建立的人设是积极沟通/解决问题,积极help team and product to improve.

有些tricky的问题,比如队友不干活怎么办,简单的回答"把活揽了"或者"跟老板告状"都是不合适的.还是要表现自己努力带领队友提升.举例(我现编的）:
My teammate needs a lot of help on debugging. when I helped him debugging, I realized his developing tool wasn't well setup and he was using merely print log to debug. I coached him to use the XXX and shared a few learning material to him. his developing speed was improved.
或者My teammate was not making progress on a project, so I asked to help and found out he was stuck in a dilemma, where coding modularity and performance conflicts and he couldn't make a decision. We went through a few design patterns and searched some language features, and realized that the XX feature of XX language can help solving this issue. In the end He was able to finish the project successfully.

还有些tricky的题比如你有没有出于紧急情况下"先斩后奏"过.这个是考察Deliver result但同时也牵涉all right a lot,反映的是你在时间紧迫的状态下做出了自己认为最有利于customer的决定（要解释为什么你认为这么做有利于customer）,并且事后证明确实保护了customer的利益.需要注意的是当时未经讨论批准的decision不能是一个 one way door,不然可能就把后人坑了.

如果面亚麻BQ的话,建议准备一个product management的例子（deal with ambiguity啊,赶deadline啊之类的）,一个debug 例子（dive deep）,一个solve challenging problem的例子,一个teamwork的例子.最后严重不建议编例子！！举的例子最好都是真的,不然面试官一眼能看出来,就着技术细节多问几句就露馅了.骗人是很大的negative datapoint！

面试官也是人,招的是未来的同事,就想象一下靠谱的同事应该是什么样的,往这上面靠就好了.然后想说的是大家在家还要多多练口语,不然出现单词说串了或者意思表达不明确就很亏,说话不用急不用赶,想清楚了慢慢说.我就先想到哪写到哪吧,有别的再加.

Recruiter: So, what do you think?

You: That's an interesting offer. I think it's probably in the
ballpark, but it's not something I'm going to sign right now. I'm
going to wait until I hear back from the other places I'm speaking to.
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Me: Hey, I finally heard back from Baz LLC. Their offer came in a lot
higher than I was expecting. They offered $150,000 in base, $200,000
in stock, and $40,000 in signing. That being said I think the work
FooCorp aligns more closely with my interests, so I'd really like to
make something work with you guys. Can we do what we can to get to
those numbers? I'd love to figure this out.

FooCorp: Wow, that's a good offer. Keep in mind FooCorp is {making the
world a better place / has amazing potential / is better for your
career} and I would hope you wouldn't be deciding based on a
paycheck. I don't know if we can match that offer exactly, but I'll
see what we can do.
