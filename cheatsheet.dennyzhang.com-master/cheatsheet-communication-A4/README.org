** Pitfalls For Geek Culture
| Name                                     | Second Thinking                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No information barrier; sharing anything | Information is power and profit margin. Only share the relevant                  |
| No hierarchy; just talk with code        | It's more about people and business                                              |
| Make all the possible improvements       | You may miss the priority and cross-functions cooperation                        |
| Value inovation over cooperation         | Working solo helps to try ideas faster; but PoC is different from products       |
| Be absolutely accurate                   | Human is not machine; So it is software development world                        |
| Curse of knowledge                       | Normal people are not dummy; they just don't have experience you have            |
| Assume everyone is with good will        | You may be set up or manipulated                                                 |
| Rarely think about monetization          | Face it. Funding is very important, even for open source projects                |
| Communication is not actionable          | Keep talking fancy tech, but few impressive highlights or actionable items       |
| Do everything in a hard way              | Intellectual challenges may not be cost effective; you can't do everything       |

 On the different level there are different kind of problems that you need to solve.

 agree

 Zoltan Paldi [2:22 PM]
 They do not enough that you can you use it or you can choose which one is fit for the given problem, they also want to know that you can compare the given implementations and products in the given purposes.
 And you also have to know what is the differences among the given solutions in a dev prospective as well.

Senior hiring:
- Why this question is good: any dev knows that every tech decision comes with good things and terrible things. I love Python, but GIL, circular imports, shitty deployment/package management, 2.x vs 3.x nonsense all suck. If you haven't been in the trenches, you can't answer this _specifically_... you can only answer it _broadly_. And it's very apparent right away to interviewer.

I'd like to get notified when people have PRs for GCM.

Curious, do you have any ideas on how to do this? https://jira.eng.vmware.com/browse/GCM-645

No idea. Haven't done that before.
Still ramping up things.
XXX YYY:spiral_calendar_pad: 10:26 AM
right, nothing to do with GC. just gilab stuff
gitlab stuff
Cool.
Is that the reason you were asking to be notified ?
Denny Zhang 10:27 AM
I noticed there are some PRs, I might be able to help.
So it shall help that I can be in the reviewer list

awesome. thank you.
Denny Zhang 10:28 AM
e.g, https://gitlab.eng.vmware.com/core-build/cluster-api-provider-wcp/merge_requests/67
We can do more than that.
There might be more differences except golang version in between local build vs gobuild.
And any part can contribute to the build failure

- 理解是什么问题,理解是什么影响
  PKS项目中, pivotal工作方式的问题与我无关.
- 想想是谁的问题.谁解决更好
- 现在解决,还是之后合适时机解决
  PKS.next中Kaiting的焦点
- 最后,才是怎么解决

Since people have different definitions of integration tests, let me clarify my perspective to provide a standard.

Unit tests focus on function-level scope.  Integration tests focus on
a higher-level functional scope.  However, integration tests are
light-weight functional tests that do not require standing up an
entire system to execute.  Integration tests typically run in the
context of a test harness that stands up processes and mocks in a
sufficient way to validate API or stack functionality in a low-cost,
time-efficient manner.
