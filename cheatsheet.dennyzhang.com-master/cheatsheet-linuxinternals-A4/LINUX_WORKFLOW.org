- MBR: master boot record, also known as first sector of the hard disk
- Initial RAM disk: The initramfs filesystem image contains programs and binary files that perform all actions needed to mount the proper root filesystem

BIOS provides three primary functions:

- Power on self test (POST), so it knows where to load the boot program.
- Load and transfer control to boot program.
- Provide drivers for all devices.

** Explain how I/O interrupt works
Basically an interrupt is a signal to notify kernel(processor) that something needs to be handled as soon as possible.

Interrupt handlers run asynchronously, and must respond to time-critical inputs quickly.

Therefore, interrupt handler is divided into top half and bottom half.

1. Top half does the minimum work to ack.
- Bottom half is the task in the workqueue. It does all the heavy lifting work.

** Explain how system call works
- System call is a middle layer between hardware and user-space processes
- Use-space application use POSIX API to invoke system call.
- System call is triggered as a soft interrupt with system call handler
- Each system call has a system call number.
- Linux provides a set of macros for wrapping access to system calls: _syscalln().
- For macros of _syscalln(), n is between 0 and 6. It shows the number of parameters passed into this syscall.

Types of System Calls:

- Process control: end, abort, create, terminate, allocate and free memory.
- File management: create, open, close, delete, read file etc.
- Device management
- Information maintenance
- Communication

** Explain how systemtap works
SystemTap is a tracing and probing tool that allows users to study and monitor the activities of the operating system (particularly, the kernel) in fine detail.
